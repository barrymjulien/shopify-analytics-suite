# Debugging Shopify Analytics Suite

## Major Issues Addressed

### 1. Authentication and Login Loop
- Fixed by implementing a dev-mode route that bypasses authentication
- Created reset scripts to clear database state and restart cleanly

### 2. Database Schema Issues
- Added proper database migrations for analytics models
- Implemented onboarding state tracking
- Fixed billing implementation

### 3. Icon Import Problems
The application was having issues with icon imports after upgrading Polaris. We tried several approaches:

#### Attempted Solutions:
1. **Direct import from @shopify/polaris-icons**
   - Failed due to export naming inconsistencies
   - Error: `The requested module '@shopify/polaris-icons' does not provide an export named 'PlusMinor'`

2. **Custom SVG components**
   - Created inline SVG components for each icon
   - Centralized in `app/lib/icons.jsx`
   - Works but adds more code to maintain

3. **React Icons library (Final Solution)**
   - Installed react-icons: `npm install react-icons`
   - Using Feather icons set (similar to Shopify's style): `import { FiArrowLeft } from 'react-icons/fi'`
   - Centralized in `app/lib/icons.jsx` with consistent naming

### 4. Prisma Generation Issues
- Experiencing `EPERM: operation not permitted` errors when running Prisma generate
- Workaround: Use `--skip-generate` flag with Prisma commands
- Long-term solution: Ensure no processes are locking the DLL file

## Quick Action Pages
Successfully implemented three analytics feature pages:
- Export Analytics Report
- Customer Segments Management
- Revenue Forecast 

All pages have been properly linked from the dashboard.

## Running the App in Dev Mode
```
npm run build
npm run deploy
npm run dev
```

If you encounter Prisma errors, try:
```
npx prisma migrate reset --skip-generate --force
```

Then visit `/app/dev-mode` to bypass authentication flows during development.
