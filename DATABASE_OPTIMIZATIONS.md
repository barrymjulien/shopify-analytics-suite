# Database Performance Optimizations

This document outlines the optimizations made to improve database performance in the Shopify Analytics Suite application.

## Added Indexes

We added the following indexes to improve query performance:

### Session Model
- Added index on `shop` for faster lookups by shop name
- Added index on `expires` for efficiently finding and clearing expired sessions

### AnalyticsCache Model
- Added index on `expiresAt` for better cache invalidation performance

### CustomerProfile Model
- Added specialized indexes for segment-based queries:
  - `[shop, segment]` for segment-based filtering
  - `[shop, lastOrderDate]` for recency queries
  - `[shop, totalSpent]` for monetary value queries

### RevenueMetric Model
- Added index on `date` for date-only queries
- Added index on `[shop, revenue]` for revenue range queries

### OnboardingState Model
- Added index on `shop` for faster lookups
- Added index on `completed` to efficiently find all users who have/haven't completed onboarding

## Query Optimizations

### Cache Management
- Replaced `findFirst` with `findUnique` for more targeted and efficient cache lookups
- Improved caching to avoid unnecessary database queries

### Batch Operations
- Implemented transaction-based batch updates for customer profiles instead of sequential updates
- This reduces database overhead by minimizing the number of database connections and transactions

### Parallel Data Loading
- Used `Promise.all` to fetch multiple data sources concurrently in the main dashboard
- This improves page load time by parallelizing database and API requests

### Transaction Usage
- Added database transactions for complex operations to ensure data consistency
- Reduced race conditions in onboarding state creation/retrieval

## Benefits

These optimizations will provide several benefits:

1. **Faster page loads**, especially for the main analytics dashboard
2. **Reduced database load** through better caching and index usage
3. **Improved scalability** for shops with many customers and orders
4. **Lower resource usage** through batched operations and parallelization
5. **Better data integrity** with transaction-based operations

## Future Optimizations

Areas for future optimization may include:

1. Implementing advanced caching strategies for analytics data
2. Adding database partitioning for larger datasets
3. Implementing query result pagination for large result sets
4. Using database views for complex, frequently accessed queries
5. Setting up database monitoring to identify slow queries
